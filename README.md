# SwiftVision
<br />
<p align="left">
    SwiftVision is a framework for image dewarping and manipulation, written in Swift and using OpenCV
</p>

> Note: There might be better and more efficient means of image processing / manipulation on iOS. This library was 
written mainly as an experiment in text dewarping using OpenCV but continued to expand to include numerous image
editing functions and various related classes. 

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+

## Installation

#### CocoaPods
You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `SwiftVision` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!
pod 'SwiftVision', :git => 'git@github.com:joeypatino/swiftvision.git'
```

## Usage example

A working example can be found in the OpenCVDemo app included in the repo. Check out the source code for function documentation.
